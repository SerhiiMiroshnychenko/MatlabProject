% Set the time interval tRange and initial conditions vector Y0.
% Your time interval should range from 0 to 1000 seconds.
tRange = [0 1000];
Y0 = [1.2;0];

% Solve the differential equation using ode45. Save the output to variables tSol and YSol.
[tSol, YSol] = ode45(@tacomaNarrows, tRange, Y0);

% Extract the first column of YSol and define it as Theta
Theta = YSol(:,1);

% Convert Theta from radians to degrees by multiplying by 180/Ï€ and storing the result back in Theta
Theta = Theta * 180 / pi;

% plot Theta vs. tSol and add an appropriate label the vertical axis such as "Road Angle".

function dYdt = tacomaNarrows(t,Y)
% Extract the position Theta from the first element of Y.

% Extract the angular velocity Omega from the second element of Y.
